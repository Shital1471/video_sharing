# Running the App

Follow these steps to run the Flutter app on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository:

   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

   Make sure you have Flutter installed. If not, you can [install it](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

   Next, navigate to the project directory and install the app's dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

### 3. Run the App:

   You can run the app on an emulator or physical device:

   - To run on a connected device or emulator:

     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

   - To specify a target device, use:

     ```bash
     flutter run -d <device_id>
     ```

   Replace `<device_id>` with the desired device (e.g., `flutter run -d web` for web, `flutter run -d android` for Android).

   The app should now launch on your chosen device or emulator.

### 4. Explore the App:

   Once the app runs, you can explore the user profile UI with various interactive elements and features.



Replace "your-username" and "your-repo-name" with your GitHub username and repository name. These instructions will guide users on clone, install dependencies, and run the Flutter app on their local environment.
